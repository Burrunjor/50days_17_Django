# pip install django
# to set up the project
# django-admin startproject titlesite .
# its creates all kinds of files, some are configs, but leave them for now
# so that was creating the project, now we want to create the app, so we run....title_application being the name
# python manage.py startapp title_apply
title_apply refers to the app, titlesite are configuration files for the project....not the app
manage.py is for the project
a project can have multiple apps and each one will have its own directory, which would be created in the same way
we then added the app name to the INSTALLED_APPS list in settings
to run a django app requires this.....of course
python manage.py runserver
with django, you start bottom up and start with the database
to stop the django app, go to the terminal and press control c

so then we go to models in the app, and use the models class to set up the columns
from now on I will comment as I go in the build of the app
and we start in the models.py file
